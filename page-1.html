        <p>Kare Kare is a popular Filipino dish that is known for its savory and nutty flavor. It is typically made with oxtail, vegetables such as eggplant and bok choy, and a thick peanut sauce. The dish is often served with steamed rice and a side of shrimp paste.

        Kare Kare is believed to have originated from the Pampanga region of the Philippines and has since become a beloved dish across the country. Its rich and flavorful sauce is created by simmering peanuts and toasted rice until they are blended into a smooth paste. The sauce is then combined with a variety of spices and cooked with the meat and vegetables until they are tender and infused with flavor.
