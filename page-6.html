        Another iconic landmark in Paris is the Arc de Triomphe. Located at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, this triumphal arch was built to commemorate the victories of the French army. Visitors can climb to the top of the arch for breathtaking views of the city, or simply admire the intricate carvings and sculptures that decorate its façade.
